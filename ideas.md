Ideas
-----

Scene manager
* Use interface to group input, update, render for each state/scene.

Party mechanics
* Indirect control
* Orders for priority targets
* Stance or agressiveness/defensiveness

Graphics
* Termbox-go built into gorl
	* Start here first
* Sprite/tile based using faiface/pixel
	* Interface with gorl tile class
* Decouple display logic from render() from the scene
* Universal UI elements
* Animation timers

Gameplay
* Secure rifts which bridge dimensions
* Rift types
	* plane - hardest to close, guarded by stronger enemies. Bridge alt universes.
	* time - bridge different timelines in the same area. Creates parallel universe. Bounties for these.
	* linear - bridge 2 positions in the same universe and time. Can be opened by player by power.
* Linear rifts opened by rift walk ability. Should have some augments/upgrade.
	* Damage on open.
	* Shorter cooldown.
	* Open remotely, teleport something to you.

Theme
* Sci-fi future realistic.
* Possibly static alien races.
* Dynamic aliens in plane rifts?
* Some sort of magic system or maybe just class tech, rift is always available.
* Support, off, def trees.
* Gun based gameplay. Rift teleport make melee somewhat viable for player only.
* "Magic" abilities can be mainly gadgets, explosives, tech.
* Spacecraft still needed for travel. Rifts only for short distances (planetary). Gov controlled linear rifts for inter system travel. (warp gates lol)

Items
* Diablo or traditional roguelike weapon generation.
* Ascii graphics possibly, which static graphics for certain upgrades.
* Diff gun types and range efficiency.

Maps
* Instance based levels rifted into.
* Exit is rift at the end for closing a rift.
* Possibly only entrance rift if fetch/bounty mission.
* Spacecraft interior.
